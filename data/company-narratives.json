      "narrative": "The Saltpond Oil field was discovered in 1970 by Sigma Amoco Consortium. The field lays 12km off the shores of Saltpond Town in 85 feet of water and covers an area of approximately 5km square. In 1976, the concession was relinquished by Sigma Amarco and was reassigned to Offshore Hydrocarbons Limited who subsequently entered into a development farm out with AgriPetco of USA. Around the years of 1977 and 1978 Agri-Petco drilled six appraisal/ development wells from a centrally located jack-up rig The jack-up was subsequently converted into a production unit and the field was put on stream in October 1978. The field interest was reassigned to Primary Fuels Incorporated (PFI) in 1984 and was shut in in mid-1985. The license then reverted to Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the field was maintained in a shut-in state. The maximum production rate attained at the Saltpond Producing fields so far was 4,800 BOPD. The field experienced a continuous decline from 4,800 BOPD in 1978 to 750 BOPD in 1984 and continued to decline to 580 BOPD by July 1985.\r\rOut of the six production wells only three were still producing as at the time of the field shut-in. GNPC commissioned several geological and engineering studies to understand the nature of the field and to make recommendation for re-development. In Feb 2000 GNPC, entered into a joint venture agreement with Lushan Eternit Energy Limited, a Ghanaian subsidiary of Lushan International energy Corporation of Houston,\rUSA, to further develop the Saltpond Field. According to the agreement signed between the two entities, Lushan will pay 30% royalty for oil, income tax in accordance with the Petroleum Income Tax Law, 1987 (PNDCI. 188), levied at the rate of thirty percent (30%), and surface rentals of US$50 per square kilometre of the area remaining at the beginning of each Contract Year as part of the development and production area. The agreement also requires Lushan to make payments for rental of government, property, public lands or for the provision of specific services requested by the company from public enterprises Lushan International Energy of Houston and Eternit Universal Limited of Nigeria also entered into Agreement whereby Eternit was to finance the Saltpond project in an amount of three million dollars (US$3,000,000.00). On the basis of these two Agreements, a joint venture and operating agreement was made on 25th February 2000 between Lushan Eternit Energy Limited and GNPC resulting in Saltpond Offshore Producing Company Limited (SOPCL) set up to operate the Saltpond Field. The initial  ownership interest of each venturer in SOPCL was:\rLushan Eternit Energy Limited - 60%\rGhana National Petroleum Corporation - 40%\rGNPC's interest contribution was in the form of Assets and logistic support to the joint venture. The Saltpond rehabilitation started in August 2000 with the repair of the \"Mr. Louie\" Jack-Up platform. \r\rBecause of operational challenges only two wells produced between 480-600 barrels of oil per day after the operation. On 11th November, 2004, a new Joint Venture Agreement was signed between GNPC and Lushan Eternit Energy Limited with ownership interest of each venturer in the Joint venture changed to Lushan - 55% GNPC - 45% GNPC's equity contributions were its existing assets at the Saltpond Oil fields comprising the production platform, Seismic data, Oil wells and studies on the Saltpond Field. At the time the assets were re-valued at ten million US dollars (US$10,000,000.00). Due to poor performance of the wells, production dropped to about 450 barrels a day. In July 2005, the wells were shut-in for maintenance and upgrading and production resumed on April 6, 2006 at an average production of 700 barrels per day with the two (2) wells."
